Cargo.lock # Often committed, but sometimes ignored in libraries. DECIDE based on policy.
           # For a library framework like Summer, COMMITTING Cargo.lock is often preferred
           # for reproducible builds, especially for examples and internal testing.
           # If end-users might complain about lockfile conflicts, consider ignoring.
           # Let's assume COMMIT for now based on common library practice.
